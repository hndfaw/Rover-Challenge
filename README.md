# Rover Challenge

This challenge consists of one function that returns the rovers' updated location and heading after it was moved from one point to another. The challenge includes a file for testing the function.

## Function description

The roverMoves function takes two parameters; one is the rover's current position, and the second one is a string that gives moving instructions to the rover. The roverMoves returns a string containing the rover's updated location, which consists of x and y-axis relative to the rover's start point and direction, which will be one of the cardinal compass points N E S W.
